Hi, you can call me Mioux. Male ins my early 30's. Computer Systens Ebgeneer.

I'm interested on helping with some projects as part of my formation. I want to learn to code, I just know the basic.

(White hat ;)

I can help translating projects into Spanish, and German abd Japanese, to some extent.

I want to contribute to these machines that have revoluzionated the world. And be a member of a friendly community where we can all share what we enjoy doing. Best wishes to all.

-Mioux
